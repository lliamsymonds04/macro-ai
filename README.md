This website uses ChatGPT prompt engineering to determine the calories and protein of food from image or text

## How it works
* The photo taken is uploaded to imgur
* That link is then passed to ChatGPT which describes what it sees
* Then that description is passed back to ChatGPT where it estimates the calories and protein
